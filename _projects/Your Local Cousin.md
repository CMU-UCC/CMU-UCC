### **Background:**

Your Local Cousin is a travel startup based in New York that connects potential clients with indigenous natives to provide either remote or in-person tourism consulting services.

### **Challenge:**

While their online platform is currently very successful, YLC wants to branch out and partner with hotels to offer their tours to a larger customer segment.

### **Methodology:**

-   *Background Research:* Before anything, we took the time to understand the functioning of YLC and the unique services it offered. Then, we conducted preliminary research to better understand the market for private tours and YLCâ€™s position within the market.
-   *User Survey:* We conducted a qualitative survey with around 100 responses to probe for relationships between traveler characteristics and tour preferences.
-   *Hotel Calls:* We conducted around fifty calls to different hotels in New York to assess the current strategy of hotels in terms of offering tours to their consumers, and their partnerships with third party companies.

### **Discoveries:**

We discovered that as of now, most hotels either outsource their tours to third party companies or only offer extremely expensive tours in-house. We also discovered that different travelers have very particular tastes in tours, and that it would be in the best interest of hotels to cater their portfolio of tour offerings to the demographics of their customers.

### **Our Impact:**

We presented our client with a deliverable and a presentation, highlighting our research methodology, observations, and recommendations. Our main goal was to arm our client with a customer acquisition strategy to deliver to hotels when setting up a partnership. The main points of the pitch included specific marketing techniques, the competitive differentiators of her offering, and an understanding of the current hotel tour landscape.
