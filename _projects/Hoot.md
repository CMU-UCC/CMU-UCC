### **Background:**

Hoot is an e-commerce start-up under the Pittsburgh Fellows program designed to help homeschooling families buy and sell used books, curricula and other education materials directly from other families.

### **Challenge:**

With the growing homeschooling market and e-commerce giants, Hoot wants to differentiate itself via unique product offering and marketing.

### **Methodology:**

- 	*Preliminary Research:* Our team started by understanding homeschooling industry as a whole and actively communicating with our client. After learning about Hoot’s offerings and goals in the near future, we delivered a project plan based on our preliminary research.
-	*Market Research:* We conducted research on the market trends, customer segmentations, and competitor analysis for both homeschooling and online bookselling. We also designed a new customer survey focussing on revenue models and product differentiation.
-	*Digital Research:* We conducted research on what digital innovations that Hoot Book Rival website could have. To increase customer base and website activity, we designed action plans and revenue models for additional features including video uploads, webinars, blogs, and online chat system.

### **Discoveries:**

Through our research, we found that currently the e-commerce giants and big homeschooling NGOs are dominating the market. Considering Hoot’s limited technological resources and market presence compared to the competitors, simply branding Hoot as a marketplace might not be effective to gain additional customer base. To stand out from the rest booksellers and homeschooling start-ups, it would be best for Hoot to leverage its focus on community, branding itself as a homeschooling hub.

### **Our Impact:**

 UCC provided Hoot with targeted market research, specific marketing techniques, and digital plans to transform the website into a homeschooling resource hub, along with projections of potential revenue streams.
